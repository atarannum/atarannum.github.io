Hello, my name is Afsana Tarannum. I am a doctoral student, studying Urban Affairs at the University of Memphis. Currently I am working as a graduate assistant. I earned a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Asia Pacific and then obtained a master’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Simultaneously I worked for an architecture firm. Afterward, I moved to the United States, where I completed a master's degree in City and Regional Planning at the University of Memphis and also worked with Self+Tucker Architects. 

I was awared as runner-up at the American Planning Association Student Design Competition in 2023 and also received the Outstanding Student Project Award from the Tennessee Chapter of the American Planning Association in 2023. My research interests are nightlife vitality, age-friendly development, and accessible public space.

- **‘Stanton Step 1: 2045 Vision Plan’**

Stanton Step 1, developed as part of a coursework project, presents a comprehensive vision for Stanton's future based on resident feedback and data analysis. It synthesizes the key issues, ideas, and strategies raised during the planning process, capturing the community's vision for the town. This document aims to guide the upcoming Stanton comprehensive planning process by capturing the community's values and concerns alongside an analysis of current conditions. It serves as a foundation for further planning efforts in anticipation of regional developments.

- **‘The Triangle Plan, Regenerative Healing for the Logan Triangle, Philadelphia’**

The Triangle Plan was a submission to the American Planning Association Student Design Competition, 2023. The plan articulates a physical vision for Philadelphia’s vacant Logan Triangle site which is consistent with the goals and values that Logan residents identified during the 2016 Logan Neighborhood planning process. While the plan primarily serves to illustrate this physical vision, it also offers a series of policy recommendations aimed at making it a reality. Additionally, the plan provides a 10-year phasing strategy, which defines timelines for both physical improvements and the adoption of recommended policies.

- **‘Chattanooga Comprehensive Plan 2030 Review Report’**

The aim of the research was to analyze the quality of the Chattanooga Comprehensive Plan 2030 with the Godschalk (2015) assessment criteria which provided a useful basis for determining the comprehensive quality of the plan. The team members graded the plan according to the criteria individually and combined the ratings as a team to provide a thorough review of the plan's strengths and weaknesses.

This research project aimed to develop an evaluation framework to measure the age-friendliness of the built
environment considering the local context and generate an age-friendly map of Dhaka City Corporations.
‘GIS Analysis of Landslide Hazard: A Case Study on Chittagong Division, Bangladesh’
This study, in brief, was undertaken to assess land suitability from a landslide perspective. Obtained findings show that a huge portion of the area is vulnerable to landslides due to unplanned housing settlements and transportation systems.
